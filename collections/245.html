<p>Collection managed by Katie Howe, Jason Webber and Sabine Hartmann for Smashfest UK, a youth engagement festival in February half term (14th Feb. â€“ 22nd Feb.) 2015</p>
<p>The premise is that an asteroid is going to destroy earth. SmashFest visitors will nominate websites to keep for future generations (time capsule idea). We have set up a web form where visitors can nominate websites to archive <a href="http://www.webarchive.org.uk/smashfest/">http://www.webarchive.org.uk/smashfest/</a></p>
